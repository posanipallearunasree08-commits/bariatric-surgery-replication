# bariatric-surgery-replication
Replication study of postoperative complications in bariatric surgery using ACS NSQIP (2014). Includes data cleaning, variable creation, statistical analysis, multivariable regression models, and visualizations (graphs &amp; charts) in SAS.
# Replication Study: Postoperative Complications in Bariatric Surgery

**Author:** Dr. Aruna Sree, BDS, MPH (Biostatistics)  
**Affiliation:** University of Nebraska Medical Center  
**Capstone Project Date:** April 2024  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project replicates and extends the study:  
Sanni, A., Perez, S., Medbery, R. et al. (2014). *Postoperative complications in bariatric surgery using age and BMI stratification*. Surg Endosc, 28, 3302â€“3309. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3606-7  

The original study investigated the association between **age, BMI, and postoperative complications** using the **ACS NSQIP dataset (2014)**.  

This replication enhances the original analysis by including:  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** â€“ addressed missing values, standardized variables, and ensured dataset quality.  
- **New Variable Creation** â€“ derived variables for stratification and regression modeling.  
- **Statistical Analysis** â€“ univariate and multivariable regression models to assess risk factors.  
- **Pure Replication** â€“ reproduced the original studyâ€™s results for validation.  
- **Measurement & Estimation Analysis (MEA)** â€“ applied alternative methods (e.g., nonparametric tests).  
- **Theory of Change Analysis (TCA)** â€“ evaluated the relationship between **diabetes status and wound complications**, adjusting for age and BMI.  
- **Visualizations** â€“ generated graphs, charts, and tables to communicate findings clearly.  

## ðŸ›  Methods
- **Software:** SAS  
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, regression analysis, multivariable modeling, stratified analysis  
- **Statistical Procedures:** Logistic regression, Chi-Square tests, multivariable models, nonparametric tests  
- **Visualization:** Charts, plots, and tables created using SAS  
- **Data Source:** ACS NSQIP (2014)  

## ðŸ“Š Results (Summary)
- Confirmed significant associations between **age, BMI, and postoperative complications**.  
- Multivariable regression models provided deeper insights into independent risk factors.  
- TCA analysis highlighted the role of **diabetes status in wound complications**.  
- Visualizations (graphs & charts) enhanced interpretability of the findings.
